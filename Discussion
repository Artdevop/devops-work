Your task is to accomplish the following:

-Dockerize the two included applications. DONE
backend/app_a/src/Dockerfile
backend/app_b/src/Dockerfile

-Apply OWASP image hardening best practices to both containers.
DONE

-Set up automated local static image scans of the resulting images using a tool like Snyk.
See README.md and Tasksfile. 

-Create a basic Kubernetes deployment for both applications. 
backend/app_a/charts
backend/app_b/charts
See README.md and Tasksfile

-The deployment should incorporate any OWASP guidance for running containers. 

RULE #2 - Set a user¶

RULE #3 - Limit capabilities (Grant only specific capabilities, needed by a container)¶

RULE #4 - Add –no-new-privileges flag¶

RULE #7 - Limit resources (memory, CPU, file descriptors, processes, restarts)¶

RULE #8 - Set filesystem and volumes to read-only¶

RULE #9 - Use static analysis tools¶

Use Kubernetes namespaces to properly isolate your Kubernetes resources¶

Assess the privileges used by containers¶

Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers¶

Limiting resource usage on a cluster¶

Securing data¶


-Ensure that all steps (build, scan, and local kubernetes deployment) can be easily performed using the included task file.
DONE


Don't Let the Dog Eat Your Homework

For delivery of this assignment, we'd like to see:

-Dockerfiles for both included applications with OWASP guidelines applied to the image.
DONE

-A Task in the Taskfile that automates local static image scans of the resulting images.
DONE

-A Kubernetes deployment file that deploys both apps using OWASP runtime guidelines.
DONE

-All work orchestrated through the included Taskfile.yaml, documentation here
DONE


Bonus Points for Any of the Following

-Separate build and deploy stages in your Dockerfiles.
DONE

-Automated local Kubernetes environment for testing.
Ingress.Yaml file created 

-Discuss how you would integrate regular scans into a CI pipeline, along with any caveats.
Any Code change should trigger the CI Build, execute the docker build (task build), do a docker scan (task scan) as part of the CI pipeline integration, and store the vulnerability reports somewhere to be reviewed by the dev / infra team to fix any vulnerability.

Docker build and scan take a lot of time so you may do some local/remote caching to speed up the build process. 

Tag the docker build with commit id to track the changes in git.


-Discuss how you would expose and secure this application publicly on Kubernetes.
Ingress Controller helps us expose the application outside the Kubernetes Cluster in a secure manner. All apps must be exposed through the Ingress Controller.
You should secure the app with TLS communication wherever possible.
In order to use the TLS, Ingress controller should be configured using a Public and Private Key with the appropriate DNS entry in the public certificate. It is good practice to purchase the DNS certificate from a well known CA Authority.
This helps us send encrypted traffic between client and server.
